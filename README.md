Computer Science I - 

Welcome to the repository where I upload all the assignments and exercises completed as part of my Computer Science I course at Hood College. This repository serves as a collection of my progress, learning, and achievements during this foundational computer science course.

About the Course:

Computer Science I introduces the fundamental concepts of programming and problem-solving. The course covers:

-Basic Programming Constructs: Variables, data types, input/output, loops, and conditionals.

-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

-Data Structures: Arrays, lists, and basic operations on them.

-Algorithms: Problem-solving strategies and logic building.



Folders:

-Assignments/: Contains all the graded assignments

-Exercises/: Includes smaller practice problems and coding drills completed during the course.
